--------------------------------------------------
                                           
Using iterative approach: sum_to_n_a(5) = 15
Using formula-based approach: sum_to_n_b(5) = 15
Using recursive approach: sum_to_n_c(5) = 15


The changes required for the Problem03.js is given below
--------------------------------------------------


Improved getPriority(): Moved to a cleaner, more maintainable lookup-based implementation.
Efficient Memoization: useMemo is now used correctly to optimize performance, with better separation of concerns for filtering, sorting, and formatting.
